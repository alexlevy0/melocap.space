# MeloCap Whitepaper

MeloCap is a music guessing game. Players bet on songs or artists related to a daily theme. At the end of each day, the most popular choices are revealed in a playlist. Players who guessed correctly earn points.
The game is designed to be fun for everyone, even if you don't know much about music. It's free to play and open-source, meaning anyone can contribute to its development.

MeloCap has a three-step plan:

1. For the first 3-6 months, players earn points for correct guesses. The creators will use this time to improve the game based on player feedback.
2. After 6-12 months, points will become a cryptocurrency called MeloCap.
3. Within 12-18 months, MeloCap will be available on cryptocurrency exchanges.

The goal is to create a community of music and gaming fans who enjoy playing and can potentially profit from their participation.
